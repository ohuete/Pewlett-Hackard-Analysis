# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose and Background
The purpose of this project is to create Entity Relationship Deiagrams (ERD's) and design tables using Structured Query Language (SQL). Pewlett Hackard is a well established company employing thousands of people. As they rapidly begin to lose employees to retirement, they are looking for ways to fill positions and distribute retirement packages for those who qualify. Applying data modeling, engineering, and analysis, I have helped Pewlett Hackard build a brand new and upgraded version of their employee data base with SQL. After I created various ERD's for Pewlett Hackard, they needed to further narrow their data. More specifically, to determine the number of retiring employees per job title and to identify employees who are eligible for their new mentorship program.
